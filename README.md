​
## My process
​
### Built with
​
- Node.js
- MySQL and Sequalize
- Express
- Insomnia
​
### What I learned
​
I feel like I really learned how to make this work but am getting errors when running it within Insomnia, being able to link and write multiple parts of a backend application is really nice.
​
### Continued development
​
I might need a little more help on this than previously thought. I went to a couple office hours to ask questions but the last one we could not figure out why I was getting "SequelizeEagerLoadingError" in insomnia
​
### Useful resources
​
Honestly the most help on this was from the class activities
